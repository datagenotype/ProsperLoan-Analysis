# Prosper Loan Analysis
## Sodiq Babatunde


## Dataset

This project is on a data set from Prosper, which is Americaâ€™s first marketplace lending platform, with over $7 billion in funded loans. This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, borrower employment status, borrower credit history, and the latest payment information. The main purpose of this project is to summarize the characteristics of variables that can affect the loan status and to get some ideas about the relationships among multiple variables using summary statistics and data visualizations. These are the libararies I used for my analysis:
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn



## Summary of Findings

 Firstly, I checked the states that have the highest listing counts and lowest counts in the United states which are 'C' and 'ND' respectively. After then, It can be deduced that people that their income range fall between $25000 and 49999 have the highest average income rate of listsing. It can also be seen that most accounts are verified, there is no high differences between people that own a house and those that don't have, and most people are currently not in any group as at the time of listing.
 We can also see that the highest loan status is 'Current', the highest employment status is 'employed' and the highest credit grade is 'C'. There is a strong correlation between interest rate and lender yield and the highest interst rate occured in the year 2011 while the lowest interest rate occured in the year 2005.
